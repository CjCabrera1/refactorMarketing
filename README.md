# Refactor Marketing Page
In this project we had to refactor a marketing website. The goal was to shorten the amount of lines of code as well as update the html to current standards. The website works perfectly fine and most likely more efficient than when it was handed over to us.

# USER STORY
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## CHANGES MADE
# Condensing in CSS
Within the CSS file most of the changes made were due to repeated code. This helped better practice DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). 

# Semantics in HTML index
Changed Title of webpage to better suit the website

Within the Index, the use of div was overused. To fix this div was replaced with semantic code "section" 

Another change that was made was renaming a class. Changed 1 class title to better match a description of what it was used for: "landingimg > hero"

Added alts to all images in case of no display in the HTML

# Usage
To use this website you can review the code for each section using Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you can view the changes that were made. 

# Website Link
